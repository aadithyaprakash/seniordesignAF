% We will be implementing the discrete dyadic wavelet transform using the
% methods from "A Wavelet-Based ECG Delineator: Evaluation on Standard
% Databases"
%
% If the prototype wavelet (mother wavelet) is the derivative of a
% smoothing function, then the Wavelet Transform of a signal at scale a is
% proportional to the derivative of the filtered signal w/ a smoothing
% impulse response @ scale a.
%
% Using literature, we have chosen to use a quadratic spline
